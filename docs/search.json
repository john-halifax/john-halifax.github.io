    "text": "Current Research Role\nGraduate Student Researcher\nAugust 2023-Present\n\\(\\textbf{University of California, Berkeley,}\\) Berkeley, CA\n\nIndependently evaluated the predictive performance of different administrative data sources to forecast fatal overdoses at the neighborhood level with machine learning in R. Performed analysis in collaboration with research teams at Brown and New York University within the context of the PROVIDENT randomized control trial in Rhode Island (NIH R01 DA046620). Established an accessible template for non-technical stakeholders to utilize machine learning to forecast fatal overdoses to allocate overdose prevention resources.\nInvestigating the effect of acute community violence on maternal and infant health and racial/ethnic health disparities as part of NIH R01 HD098138. Processing data for over 6 million study individuals over more than a decade. Developing time series models for exposure assessment and implementing novel targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) methods for causal inference."
