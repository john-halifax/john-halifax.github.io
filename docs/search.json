    "text": "I’m John Halifax, a PhD student in Epidemiology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. I broadly explore the role of neighborhood and place as determinants of health from an ecosocial perspective using flexible, minimally-assumptive causal inference methods. My current research includes extending causal inference methods to account for neighborhood specific confounding effects in multilevel, high-dimensional data settings, examining the effect of acute community violence on perinatal outcomes, and utilizing machine learning to forecast fatal overdose at the neighborhood level. Prior to pursuing a PhD, I worked at the intersection of analytical chemistry, community health, and the overdose crisis at San Francisco AIDS Foundation and UC San Francisco. I hold an MS in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley and a BS in Chemistry \\(\\textit{magna cum laude,}\\) from Haverford College. Outside of work, you will find me riding my bicycle, reading the newspaper, or watching my favorite soccer team lose again."
