I broadly explore the role of neighborhood and place as determinants of health from an ecosocial perspective using flexible, minimally-assumptive causal inference methods. My current research includes:\n\nExtending causal inference methods to account for neighborhood specific confounding effects in multilevel, high-dimensional data settings\nExamining the effect of acute community violence on perinatal outcomes in California\nUtilizing machine learning to forecast fatal overdose at the neighborhood level\n\nPrior to pursuing a PhD, I worked at the intersection of analytical chemistry, community health, and the overdose crisis at San Francisco AIDS Foundation and UC San Francisco. I hold an MS in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley and a BS in Chemistry magna cum laude, from Haverford College. Outside of work, you will find me riding my bicycle, reading the newspaper, or watching my favorite soccer team."

    "text": "Graduate Student Instructor\nDivision of Epidemiology, UC Berkeley\nFall 2025\n\nServed as teaching assistant to Professor Patrick Bradshaw for course PH252 Epidemiological Methods. Course topics include generalized linear models, Kaplan-Meier estimation, survival distributions, and models for parametric and semi-parametric survival analysis, as well as methods for confounder selection, dose-response modeling, and interaction and effect modification. \n\nConference Workshop Co-Instructor\nSociety for Epidemiologic Research Annual Meeting\nJune 2025\n\nCo-instructed a workshop applying the Causal Roadmap to estimate causal effects with multiple intervention variables, such as the cumulative effect of an exposure over time and the effects on survival-type outcomes with right-censoring. Covered longitudinal causal models, identification in the presence of time-dependent confounding, and estimation of joint treatment effects using G-computation, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner. Led participants through the Roadmap using an applied example and implementation of these estimators with the ltmle package in R."
